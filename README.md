This is the repository for Stefano project and thesis

# Project
* Prediction of potential active open chromatin regions using CAGE data

## Week 1, 2
* Familiarize with the problem and data
* Understand dREG input and output

## Week 3 
* Implemented exploration and input profiles extraction (1 replicate) for ML models
* Implemented first ML models: random forest, lightGBM, SVM RBF
* Models evaluation

## Week 4
* Implemented profiles extraction using all replicates
* To do: 
    - Thesis contract
    - Split train into train and validation for tuning
    - Assess pos profiles filtering, negative ranges extraction
    - Perform SVM and lightGBM hyperparameter tuning
