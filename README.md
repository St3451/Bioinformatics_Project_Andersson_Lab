## Week 1, 2
* Familiarize with the problem and data
* Understand dREG input and output

## Week 3 
* Implemented exploration and input profiles extraction for ML models
* Implemented first ML models: random forest, lightGBM, SVM RBF

## Week 4
* To do: 
    - Assess pos profiles filtering, negative ranges extraction, merge and use all replicates;
