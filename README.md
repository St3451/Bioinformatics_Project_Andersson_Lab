# Bioinformatics project (thesis pilot study) at Andersson Lab

This repository contains the report, presentation slides, and code of the bioinformatics project I did at the Andersson Lab (Bioinformatics Centre, Department of Biology, University of Copenhagen). 
The aim of the project was to estabilish the feasibility of the method I will be using in the thesis.
